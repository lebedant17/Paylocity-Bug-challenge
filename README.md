# Report for Paylocity Bug challenge


Thank you for reviewing my bug-finding findings for the sample Benefits Dashboard application. 
Below is a summary of the identified issues and how to access additional resources for further review:

### Issues:
All bugs discovered during the bug-finding challenge have been documented in the **"Issues"** tab of this repository. 

They are sorted into two categories: `API` and `UI`, allowing for easy navigation and reference.

### Postman Collection:
For your convenience, I have included a Postman collection file in this repository. The collection is an extension of the one provided with the task, featuring additional requests and tests relevant to the bug-finding exercise. 
Please note that while the collection is functional, it may not be perfectly structured as it was primarily used as a helper during testing.

### Discussion:
I am available to discuss the identified issues and the bug-finding process in more detail during the interview. If you have any questions or require further clarification on any aspect of the bug reports or testing methodology, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this challenge. I look forward to our discussion.
